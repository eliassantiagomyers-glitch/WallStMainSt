                significance: "Contextualizes the fragility of the banking system before federal insurance (FDIC). It highlights the difference between local 'building and loan' institutions (relational banking) versus impersonal commercial finance, and how panic can destroy solvent institutions."

                significance: "Represents a major shift in modern markets from individual retail ownership to concentrated professional management. They wield significant power in corporate governance and market movements due to the sheer volume of capital they control."

                significance: "Democratized access to the stock market, allowing middle-class individuals to achieve diversification and professional management that would be difficult to obtain directly. However, they traditionally involve active management fees."

            {
                term: "Index Funds",
                definition: "A type of mutual fund or ETF designed to track the components of a financial market index (like the S&P 500) rather than actively selecting stocks.",
                significance: "Associated with the rise of 'passive investing' and John Bogle. The significance lies in the Efficient Market Hypothesis—the idea that it is nearly impossible for active managers to consistently beat the market long-term, making low-fee indexing a superior strategy for most."

                significance: "Marks a massive shift in risk from employers to employees. In the postwar era, DB plans were standard; today, DC plans dominate, meaning individuals bear the market risk for their retirement."

                significance: "A critical fiscal issue for many states and cities (like Detroit). It highlights the political incentives to promise benefits without raising enough taxes to fund them, leading to long-term financial crises."

                significance: "Fueled the expansion of the American middle class, the suburbia boom (Levittowns), and mass higher education. However, it significantly excluded Black veterans from many benefits due to discriminatory implementation."

                significance: "Set the pattern for labor relations in the postwar era, creating a 'private welfare state' tied to employment rather than government, and solidifying the middle-class status of industrial workers."

                significance: "Shows the effects of high marginal tax rates, strong unions, and New Deal policies. Its reversal marks the beginning of the modern era of high inequality (the 'Great Divergence')."

                significance: "Became the engine of the U.S. economy in the postwar era. It redefined American citizenship and freedom in terms of 'freedom to choose' products, fueled by advertising and credit."

                significance: "Dominant business form in the 1960s. They fell out of favor in the 1980s as 'shareholder value' theory pushed for breaking them up to focus on 'core competencies' and efficiency."
