                definition: "A 1946 film often discussed in financial history to illustrate the mechanics of a 'bank run' and the role of fractional reserve banking.",
                significance: "Contextualizes the fragility of the banking system before federal insurance (FDIC). It highlights the difference between local 'building and loan' institutions (relational banking) versus impersonal commercial finance, and how panic can destroy solvent institutions."
            },
            {
                term: "Institutional Investors",
                definition: "Large organizations—such as pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and endowments—that pool money to invest securities, real estate, and other assets.",
                significance: "Represents a major shift in modern markets from individual retail ownership to concentrated professional management. They wield significant power in corporate governance and market movements due to the sheer volume of capital they control."
            },
            {
                term: "Mutual Funds",
                definition: "An investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities.",
                significance: "Democratized access to the stock market, allowing middle-class individuals to achieve diversification and professional management that would be difficult to obtain directly. However, they traditionally involve active management fees."
            },
            {
                term: "Index Funds",
                definition: "A type of mutual fund or ETF designed to track the components of a financial market index (like the S&P 500) rather than actively selecting stocks.",
                significance: "Associated with the rise of 'passive investing' and John Bogle. The significance lies in the Efficient Market Hypothesis—the idea that it is nearly impossible for active managers to consistently beat the market long-term, making low-fee indexing a superior strategy for most."
            },
            {
                term: "Defined Benefit Plan vs. Defined Contribution Plan",
                definition: "Defined Benefit (DB): Employer guarantees a specific retirement payout (pension). Defined Contribution (DC): Employer/employee contribute to an account (401k), payout depends on investment performance.",
                significance: "Marks a massive shift in risk from employers to employees. In the postwar era, DB plans were standard; today, DC plans dominate, meaning individuals bear the market risk for their retirement."
            },
            {
                term: "Shareholder Activism",
                definition: "The practice of shareholders using their equity stake in a corporation to influence its management and policies.",
                significance: "Rose to prominence in the 1980s (and again recently with ESG). It shifted corporate focus towards maximizing shareholder value, sometimes at the expense of other stakeholders like employees or long-term R&D."
            },
            {
                term: "Unfunded Liabilities (in public pension plans)",
                definition: "The difference between the estimated value of future pension benefits that have been promised and the assets currently set aside to pay for them.",
                significance: "A critical fiscal issue for many states and cities (like Detroit). It highlights the political incentives to promise benefits without raising enough taxes to fund them, leading to long-term financial crises."

                term: "War of Machines",
                definition: "A term often referring to the intense industrial production competition, particularly during WWII, or metaphors for industrial capitalism's dominance.",
                significance: "Demonstrates the scale of American industrial power in the mid-20th century, which underpinned the postwar economic boom and the rise of the large corporation."

                significance: "Fueled the expansion of the American middle class, the suburbia boom (Levittowns), and mass higher education. However, it significantly excluded Black veterans from many benefits due to discriminatory implementation."

                term: "Treaty of Detroit",
                definition: "A 1950 contract between GM and the UAW where the union traded the right to bargain over product pricing/management for generous wages, COLA, and benefits.",
                significance: "Set the pattern for labor relations in the postwar era, creating a 'private welfare state' tied to employment rather than government, and solidifying the middle-class status of industrial workers."
            },

                definition: "The period in the mid-20th century (approx. 1940s–1970s) where the gap between the rich and poor in the U.S. was significantly narrower than before or since.",
                significance: "Shows the effects of high marginal tax rates, strong unions, and New Deal policies. Its reversal marks the beginning of the modern era of high inequality (the 'Great Divergence')."

                definition: "Legislation that authorized the construction of the Interstate Highway System, justified as necessary for national defense.",
                significance: "Transformation of American geography and economy. Facilitated the rise of suburbs, trucking (over rail), and the national consumer market, while often destroying urban minority neighborhoods."

                significance: "Became the engine of the U.S. economy in the postwar era. It redefined American citizenship and freedom in terms of 'freedom to choose' products, fueled by advertising and credit."

            {
                term: "Consumer Finance",
                definition: "The sector of the economy dedicated to lending money to individuals for personal or household use (credit cards, auto loans, mortgages).",
                significance: "Enabled the consumption boom despite stagnant real wages in later decades. It shifted the economy from being production-driven to debt-fueled consumption."

                term: "Conglomerates",
                definition: "Large corporations that consist of many smaller companies in unrelated industries (e.g., ITT, GE).",
                significance: "Dominant business form in the 1960s. They fell out of favor in the 1980s as 'shareholder value' theory pushed for breaking them up to focus on 'core competencies' and efficiency."

                definition: "The process of social and economic change caused by the removal or reduction of industrial capacity or activity in a country or region.",
                significance: "Led to the 'Rust Belt,' loss of high-paying union jobs, and the hollowing out of the middle class, contributing to political polarization and regional inequality."

                definition: "The decline in the percentage of the labor force belonging to trade unions.",

                significance: "Designed to protect small retail shops ('Mom and Pop') from chain stores (like A&P) that could use bulk buying power to undercut prices. Relevant to modern debates about Amazon/Walmart."
